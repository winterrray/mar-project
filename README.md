# Object counting system

## Introduction
The MAR Project proposes an object counting system using Arduino Uno and IR sensors to count and monitor the number of objects passing through a specific area. This system finds applications in various fields such as manufacturing plants, retail stores, and public areas. Its aim is to provide accurate object counts to enhance efficiency and minimize errors.

## Working
The object counting system employs Arduino Uno and IR sensors to detect objects passing through a monitored area. IR sensors placed at entry points detect objects, and as they pass through, the count increases. The Arduino Uno board processes this information and displays the count on an LCD display, accompanied by an LED indicator.

## Sensor Working (Input & Output)
IR sensors emit and receive infrared signals. When an object passes through the monitored area, these signals are reflected back to the sensor. The sensor then sends the received signals to the Arduino Uno board. The board processes this input and outputs the count on the LCD display.

## Applications
### Production Line
The system can count items produced on a production line, aiding in monitoring efficiency and identifying potential bottlenecks.

### Traffic Counting
It can be used to count vehicles passing through specific points on roads, enabling traffic analysis and planning.

## Conclusion
The object counting system proposed by the MAR Project using Arduino Uno and IR sensors is reliable and efficient. It accurately detects objects and counts them as they pass through the monitored area. This system has the potential to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance productivity across various applications.
